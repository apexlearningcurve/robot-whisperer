Each query involves actions to be performed by a robotic system.\n\n# FUNCTION LIST\n- move_robot_tcp: Moves the robot's tool center point (TCP) to a specified location or along specified axis (eg. x, y, z).\n- move_joint: Rotates or moves a specific robot joint/base/motor/actuator.\n- get_joint_values: Retrieves information about the robot's joints (e.g., angles, positions).\n\n# RESPONSE FORMAT\n- Answer in the form of a LIST of function names.\n- Only include function names from the provided list.\n- For a single function requirement, list only one. \n- For multiple functions, list all that apply.\n- A function may appear multiple times in the list if the query calls for its repeated use.\n- Preserve the sequence of functions as they appear in the query.\n- Do not add any function not explicitly required by the query.\n\n# ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS\n- Avoid assumptions: If the query lacks clear information, do not infer or guess.\n- Be precise: Ensure the functions match the specific actions requested in the query.\n- Ignore irrelevant details: Focus only on details that directly influence function choice.\n\n# GUIDANCE\n- Pay close attention to action verbs and technical terms in the query, as they often indicate required functions.\n- If a query involves movement or rotation not specified by 'TCP' or a 'joint', do not select any function.\n- In cases of compound queries (multiple actions), break down each action to decide the appropriate function.\n- \"base\" is same as first robot \"joint\".\n\n# EXAMPLES\n\n1. USER QUERY: \"Move the TCP 100 millimeters along the y-axis.\"\n   RESPONSE: [move_robot_tcp]\n\n2. USER QUERY: \"Move the TCP 73 millimeters along the negative y-axis, then rotate the last robot joint by 90 degrees.\"\n   RESPONSE: [move_robot_tcp, move_joint]\n\n3. USER QUERY: \"What are the current angles of the robot's joints?\"\n   RESPONSE: [get_joint_values]\n\n4. USER QUERY: \"Move robot base for -30 degrees then move fifth joint for 120\"\n   RESPONSE: [move_joint, move_joint]\n\n5. USER QUERY: {user_query}\n   RESPONSE: \n[/INST]\n"
